CLI Blackjack
===============


Welcome! This is a Python Programming training exercise.

The goal is to design and test the game of blackjack so it operates in with a Command Line Interface.

This assumes you have a general environment for python development as described in the [Onboarding](https://github.com/macandmia/codex/wiki/Onboarding) docs.

You only need to have a working installation of Pyenv, and Python 3.6.3 installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/macandmia/blackjack ${MM_DIR}/blackjack
cd ${MM_DIR}/blackjack
./install
```
